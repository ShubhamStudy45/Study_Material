JSX :

JSX is a library
JavaScript SML
Its template used by React to create a user interface

const template = 'this is the template data'
const root = document.getElementById('app')
ReactDOM.render(template, root)

if you want to put html tag (below EX) inside the JSX then we should use babel 

const template = <h2>this is the template data</h2> --> would not work in JSX

babel is nothing but the transpiler or complier or JavaScript complier
